A hardware-accelerated market data parser achieving sub-100ns packet processing latency on FPGA. Designed for real-time financial data feeds with zero packet loss and configurable message filtering.
#ðŸŽ¯ Overview
TickStream-FPGA is a production-grade FPGA implementation of a NASDAQ ITCH 5.0 protocol parser optimized for high-frequency trading applications. The design processes Ethernet/IP/UDP packets in real-time, extracts ITCH market data messages, and applies configurable filtering to reduce downstream processing overhead.
